    This file manages the data to feed to model.
 
 
    To ease data management, this code uses the Pandas python package. 
    Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive.
    The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in many areas of engineering. 
    | In this DataHelper class, each data as pandas.DataFrame is given as a parameter.
